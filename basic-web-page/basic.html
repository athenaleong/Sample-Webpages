    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>

    <p>Unordered List:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
          an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <p> <em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw <strong> attention </strong> to a particular <em><strong>word</strong></em> or phrase. </p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>This paragraph needs some space below it...</p>
    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p>So, I added some hard line breaks.</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
    soon.</p>
